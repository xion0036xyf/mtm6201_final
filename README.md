## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a high-fidelity wireframe for my **UX Design I** course by using the web development techniques I have learned in **Web Development II**.  

The high-fidelity wireframe I designed for UX focuses on a website for **dog and cat adoption and donation**. The website consists of **three pages**:
- **Home Page**
- **Adoption Page**
- **Donation Page**

## Process and Challenges

This project was a big challenge for me because it was the first time I wrote HTML and CSS code without any assignment guidelines or hints from Brightspace. It felt like trying to build a skyscraper from nothing, all by myself. Soon, I found myself like a baby just learning to walk without holding a parent's hand.

The next challenge was balancing between my hi-fi wireframe and front-end code. At times, I felt frustrated and wished I could go back to when I designed the wireframe and tell myself, "Stop making unrealistic designs!" I realized that web development is an iterative processâ€”you have to go back and modify your work countless times.

The biggest help I relied on was the tutorials I found on YouTube. These videos taught me a lot about front-end development, especially Bootstrap. To me, Bootstrap felt like learning another language after becoming familiar with HTML and CSS. Watching these videos was incredibly helpful in understanding how to structure and style my project.
